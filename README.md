# Portfolio
My Portfolio is an application where users can see my work portfolio and any useful information about me. It is easily accessible using navigation links, headings and sections, images representing previous projects,and links to contact me. You can click on navigational links to bring you to certain sections, click on project links to open up past projects, and click on contact links for forms of contact.

## Link
You can use this link (https://sergiogomez100000.github.io/Portfolio/.) to travel to my portfolio.

## Usage

You can use my portfolio to learn a little about me,look into my past projects, information on me and how to contact me.

## Roadmap
aside from making it look stylish, I want to insert real projects once I've made any so employers can see my projects.I want to format better when seen on different screen sizes.
